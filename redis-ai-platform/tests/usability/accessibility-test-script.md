- VoiceOver (macOS)
- TalkBack (Android)
- VoiceOver (iOS)

### Browsers
- Chrome with ChromeVox
- Firefox with NVDA
- Safari with VoiceOver
- Edge with Narrator

### Keyboard Navigation
- Standard keyboard
- Keyboard with sticky keys enabled
- Keyboard with filter keys enabled

### Display Settings
- High contrast mode
- Text size at 200%
- Zoom at 200%
- Reduced motion settings enabled

## Test Procedures

### 1. Keyboard Navigation Testing

#### 1.1 Tab Order
1. Start at the top of the page
2. Press Tab repeatedly to navigate through all interactive elements
3. Verify that the tab order follows a logical sequence
4. Verify that all interactive elements receive focus
5. Verify that the current focus is clearly visible at all times

#### 1.2 Keyboard Controls
1. Verify that all buttons can be activated with Enter or Space
2. Verify that dropdown menus can be opened with Enter, Space, or Arrow Down
3. Verify that radio buttons can be selected with Arrow keys
4. Verify that checkboxes can be toggled with Space
5. Verify that sliders can be adjusted with Arrow keys
6. Verify that modal dialogs can be closed with Escape
7. Verify that no keyboard traps exist (elements that can receive focus but cannot be exited using the keyboard)

#### 1.3 Keyboard Shortcuts
1. Verify that any keyboard shortcuts are documented
2. Verify that keyboard shortcuts do not conflict with browser or screen reader shortcuts
3. Verify that keyboard shortcuts can be disabled if needed

### 2. Screen Reader Testing

#### 2.1 Page Structure
1. Use the screen reader to navigate through headings (H1-H6)
2. Verify that headings are properly nested and provide a clear document outline
3. Use the screen reader to navigate through landmarks (main, navigation, etc.)
4. Verify that all sections of the page have appropriate landmarks

#### 2.2 Text Alternatives
1. Verify that all images have appropriate alt text
2. Verify that decorative images have empty alt text or are implemented as CSS backgrounds
3. Verify that complex images (charts, diagrams) have detailed descriptions
4. Verify that icon buttons have accessible names

#### 2.3 Form Controls
1. Verify that all form controls have proper labels
2. Verify that error messages are announced by screen readers
3. Verify that required fields are properly indicated
4. Verify that form validation errors are announced

#### 2.4 Dynamic Content
1. Verify that dynamic content updates are announced by screen readers
2. Verify that loading states are announced
3. Verify that success and error messages are announced
4. Verify that modal dialogs properly trap focus and are announced

### 3. Color and Contrast Testing

#### 3.1 Text Contrast
1. Use a contrast checker tool to verify that all text meets WCAG AA requirements:
   - Regular text: 4.5:1 contrast ratio
   - Large text: 3:1 contrast ratio
2. Verify that text remains readable in high contrast mode

#### 3.2 UI Component Contrast
1. Verify that UI components (buttons, form controls) meet the 3:1 contrast ratio requirement
2. Verify that focus indicators have sufficient contrast
3. Verify that hover and active states have sufficient contrast

#### 3.3 Color Dependence
1. Verify that color is not the only means of conveying information
2. Verify that links are underlined or otherwise distinguishable from surrounding text
3. Verify that error states use both color and another indicator (icon, text)
4. Test the interface in grayscale to ensure it remains usable

### 4. Responsive Design and Zoom Testing

#### 4.1 Text Resizing
1. Increase text size to 200% in browser settings
2. Verify that no text is cut off or overlapping
3. Verify that the layout adjusts appropriately
4. Verify that no horizontal scrolling is required

#### 4.2 Page Zoom
1. Zoom the page to 200% using browser zoom
2. Verify that all content remains visible and usable
3. Verify that the layout adjusts appropriately
4. Verify that no horizontal scrolling is required

#### 4.3 Responsive Breakpoints
1. Test the interface at various screen sizes:
   - Desktop (1920x1080)
   - Laptop (1366x768)
   - Tablet (768x1024)
   - Mobile (375x667)
2. Verify that the layout adjusts appropriately at each size
3. Verify that all content remains accessible
4. Verify that touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels on mobile devices

### 5. ARIA Implementation Testing

#### 5.1 ARIA Landmarks
1. Verify that appropriate ARIA landmarks are used:
   - `role="banner"` for the header
   - `role="navigation"` for navigation menus
   - `role="main"` for the main content
   - `role="complementary"` for sidebars
   - `role="contentinfo"` for the footer

#### 5.2 ARIA Attributes
1. Verify that ARIA attributes are used correctly:
   - `aria-label` for elements without visible text
   - `aria-labelledby` to reference visible text
   - `aria-describedby` for additional descriptions
   - `aria-required="true"` for required form fields
   - `aria-expanded` for expandable elements
   - `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative elements

#### 5.3 ARIA Live Regions
1. Verify that dynamic content updates use appropriate ARIA live regions:
   - `aria-live="polite"` for non-critical updates
   - `aria-live="assertive"` for critical updates
   - `role="status"` for status messages
   - `role="alert"` for error messages

### 6. Cognitive Accessibility Testing

#### 6.1 Clear Instructions
1. Verify that instructions are clear and concise
2. Verify that error messages are helpful and suggest solutions
3. Verify that complex tasks are broken down into manageable steps

#### 6.2 Consistent Navigation
1. Verify that navigation is consistent across the feature
2. Verify that buttons and controls are consistently labeled
3. Verify that similar actions produce similar results

#### 6.3 Predictable Behavior
1. Verify that interactive elements behave as expected
2. Verify that changes of context (e.g., form submission) are predictable
3. Verify that no unexpected automatic changes occur
