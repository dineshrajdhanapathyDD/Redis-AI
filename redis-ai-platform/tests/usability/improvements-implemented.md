### CSS Improvements

1. **Touch Target Sizing**:
   ```css
   .certification-roadmap__btn {
       min-height: 44px;
       min-width: 44px;
   }
   
   @media (max-width: 767px) {
       .certification-roadmap__btn {
           min-height: 48px;
           padding: 0.75rem 1rem;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **High Contrast Mode**:
   ```css
   @media (prefers-contrast: high) {
       .certification-roadmap__card {
           border: 3px solid #000000;
           box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #000000;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Mobile Responsive**:
   ```css

           min-height: 48px;
       }
   }
   ```

### JavaScript Enhancements

   function announce(message, priority = 'polite') {
       const region = priority === 'assertive' ? statusRegion : liveRegion;
       region.textContent = message;
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Button Feedback**:
   ```javascript
   button.addEventListener('click', function() {
       const buttonText = this.textContent.trim();
       const isPressed = this.getAttribute('aria-pressed') === 'true';
       announce(`${buttonText} ${isPressed ? 'activated' : 'deactivated'}.`);
   });
   ```

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
       if (e.altKey && e.key >= '1' && e.key <= '6') {
           // Navigate to workflow steps
       }
